# Project Title

Time-Series Data Reporter

## About This Project

This is a set of scripts that acquire data from a modified-output OpenTSDB datastore, analyze and format according to the configured options, and deliver as set in the configuration.


### Prerequisites

A Linux system with bash, awk, Python 2.7, and the following Python modules:

* collections
* pprint
* argparse
* csv
* datetime
* logging
* math
* requests
* sys
* tempfile
* time
* xlsxwriter
* yaml

Some modules will have to be installed, as they are not typically part of the default installation.

### Additional notes

More documentation to come.  This is slow due to the need to obtain clearance from a previous employer to post code samples.
