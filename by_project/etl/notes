This repo pulls data from a TSD using the tsdb script's scan capability, 
reduces the tags to a minimal tag/value set, compresses the resulting set, and 
pushes to a server that temporarily hosts the compressed files.

As initially configured, this repository is placed in:
    root@<jumpbox>:<full_directory_path>

It pulls time series data from the server ma-tsd01 via ssh using the script:
    ma-tsd01:/usr/share/opentsdb/bin/tsdb

For example, the to query for vnx_available data, the script runner.sh in this 
repo sends this command to ma-tsd01:
    /usr/share/opentsdb/bin/tsdb scan --import 15m-ago avg vnx_available

The data is received back to the runner.sh script via SSH and piped to the 
script tagset.py, which reduces the dataset to the minimum set of tags and 
values.  Once reduced, the data is compressed with the standard gzip utility 
and SCP'd to;
    root@<storage_box>:<full_path_to_storage_directory>

Once there, it remains until the Grafana server (which also happens to be the 
feeder to the OpenTSDB service) pulls the files via rsync, deletes the 
source files, and sends the data to OpenTSDB.
